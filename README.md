## "Mirror Mirror on the wall..."

Inspired by the legendary mirror from Snow White, this smart mirror project combines cutting-edge technology with fairy tale enchantment. Unlike its fictional counterpart, this mirror is designed to recognize and respond only to one special person - making it truly the fairest tech of all.

## ✨ Features

- **Exclusive Face Recognition**: Responds only to authorized user (my wife)
- **Voice Interaction**: Natural language processing for conversational experiences
- **Speech-to-Text**: Accurately captures and processes spoken commands
- **Intelligent Responses**: Context-aware conversation capabilities
- **Command Center**: Quick access to essential information and home controls

## 🧠 Core Technologies

- Computer Vision with TensorFlow for precise face recognition
- Natural Language Processing for understanding context and intent
- Custom wake-word detection for hands-free activation
- Responsive UI designed for mirror display
- Privacy-focused design with all processing done locally

## 📋 Basic Commands

| Command | Function |
|---------|----------|
| "Mirror Mirror On The Wall" | Activates the system |
| "Whats The Time?" | Displays current and forecasted weather |
| "stop listening" | Taunts that it can not be turned off |
